## APIConnect Example Generator

### Description

This module is used to generate code snippets and example objects from OpenAPI document contents. It is used by API Designer, API Manager, API Explorer and the Developer Portal.

It provides three functions:

* `generateCodeSnippets` - generate a set of code snippets for various languages which demonstrate invoking a given operation.
* `generateExampleResponse` - generates an example response object for the given operation by looking for schema definitions first for a 200 response, then a 201 response, and finally a default response.
* `generateExampleparameter` - generates an example parameter for the given operation parameter, optionally supplying a content type (XML or JSON), and also optionally beautifying the response for readability.
