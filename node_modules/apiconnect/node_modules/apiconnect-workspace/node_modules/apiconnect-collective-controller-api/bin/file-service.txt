  upload                Generic file upload to accessible directories in the
                        controller.
  uploadPackage         Uploads a npm package to the controller into the
                        `${wlp.usr.dir}/usr/shared/stackGroups/apic` directory.
                        This package is used for deploying applications to
                        member hosts and it is required that all node
                        depedencies be installed and included into the package.
  uploadScalingPolicy   Uploads the scaling policy XML file to the controller
                        into the controller's `configDropins/overrides`
                        directory. The controller will detect this policy and
                        trigger off a deploy process.
  uploadDeployRules     Uploads the deploy.xml to the controller into the same
                        location as the package. This file includes values used
                        in the deployRules.xml code when doing a deploy.
  deploy                Does an `uploadPackage`, `uploadDeployRules`, waits 15
                        seconds, then `uploadScalingPolicy`. This avoids race
                        conditions in the deploy process.
