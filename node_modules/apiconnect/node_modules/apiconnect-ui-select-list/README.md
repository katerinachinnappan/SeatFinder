# apiconnect-ui-select-list
Component used to display a list of items with checkboxes, the ability to select or deselect all items with one checkbox, and delete multiple items with one button.

To use:
* Insert the select all component into your HTML file as you would a directive:
    * `<apic-select-list></apic-select-list>`

* Add the following attributes to your component:
    * `items`: dynamic list of items the user can select
    * `route`: type of item; used for redirecting when user clicks an item from the list
    * `item-type`: item type or description
    * `on-delete`: the function (with item parameter) to call when deleting a single item
    * `multi-delete` (optional): the function (with items parameter) to call when deleting multiple items all at once

* Example:
`<apic-select-list
items="dataSources"
route="datasource"
item-type="{{'loopBackDataSource' | translate}}"
on-delete="deleteDataSource(item)"
multi-delete="checkSelectedDs(selectedList)">
</apic-select-list>`
